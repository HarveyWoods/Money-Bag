### About HODL Bag
Over 3 Million Bitcoin have been lost forever, costing investors over $27 Billion (USD). To solve this problem, the team at Harvey Woods created HODL Bag, which is designed to provide the most secure, cost-effective, and globally accessible method of securing cryptocurrency investments without the need for a traditional banking institution.
